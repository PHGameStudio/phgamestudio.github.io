# Antigravity SetUp Tutorial

---

## 1. Download

Antigravity can be downloaded from [www.antigravity.google](https://www.antigravity.google).

This is an AI IDE similar to windsurf but with more powerful **Vibe Coding and Agentic Ability**, so all settings on windsurf can be applied to antigravity.

## 2. Account Requirement

1. You need to have a **Google account** to use Antigravity.

2. this account must be at least 18 years old. (if your account is verified under 18, try to sign another one)

3. go to https://policies.google.com/terms and check the location of your account. </br> 
If it's in **China mainland, Hongkong, Macao**, your account is **Not Available**, and we suggest you to **create a new account** instead of changing location.(China Taiwan is available)

## 3. Environment requirement

1. you need a VPN with node in **outside of China mainland, Hongkong, Macao**

2. Either Rules or Global can open Antigravity. But **MUST open TUN mode in your VPN**. If you couldn't find, try another VPN container such as **ClashX Meta** on mac.

3. check if your **DNS is enabled**. This is **CRUTIAL** for Antigravity to work. If not and you don't know how, ask your chatGPT or gemini to help you.

## 4. Model selection
